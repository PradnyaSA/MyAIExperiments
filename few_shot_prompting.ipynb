        "## About the notebook\n",
        "This notebook demonstrates a Prompt Engineering technique called few-shot prompting.\n",
        "It shows how few-shot prompting fine-tunes the model's behavior for a specific task and context.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "*Pre-requisites:* To run this notebook, you need an access key to the OpenAI API. You can get your API key from [openai](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Topic: few-shot Prompting\n",
        "Evolving models with sophisticated reasoning abilities thrive on techniques such as Chain-of-Thought(CoT), few-shot prompting.<br>\n",
        "Few-shot prompting is a technique where you give the model a few examples of a task before asking it to complete a new, similar task. Instead of just giving a single instruction, you provide a handful of high-quality examples. It's most effective when built using a structured approach with consistent, concise examples.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is how few-shot prompting works:<br>\n",
        "- Task: Classify the sentiment of customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.\n",
        "- Examples:\n",
        " - review: \"Great product for such a low price! Love it!\"\n",
        " - Category: positive<br>\n",
        "  \n",
        " - review: \"Poor quality of material, lost shine in a month.\"\n",
        " - Category: negative<br>\n",
        "\n",
        " - review: \"I was able to use it as a one-time use product. Looking at the low price, I got what I paid for, so I can't complain.\"\n",
        " - Category: neutral<br>  \n",
        "\n",
        "- Now, classify this review:\n",
        " - review: \"I ordered in medium size, but it's quite small compared to how it appears online. The Size chart is incorrect.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "What do you think the response would be?\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "Few-shot prompting enables the AI model to perform consistently in a cost-effective manner, and it particularly excels at routine, pattern-recognition tasks, freeing up your capacity for the complex tasks. You would not want to miss that benefit!\n",
