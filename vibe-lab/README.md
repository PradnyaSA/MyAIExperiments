Create a React web application for a Budget Dashboard based on credit card transactions. 
Analyze the input dataset from the user_credit_card_transactions.csv file, then generate a small sample dataset for the web app. The Sample should contain 20 records; each record should have the user's expense category derived from the merchant category code (MCC), description, transaction date, and $ amount. The home page should display a table of categorized transactions. Never display raw MCC code. Add the ability to set a budget per expense category. Display a simple chart of budget vs actual expense and a pie chart of the user's overall spending.
