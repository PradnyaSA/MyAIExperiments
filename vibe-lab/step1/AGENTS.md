# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- `budget-dashboard-app/`: React + TypeScript app (Create React App).
- `budget-dashboard-app/src/`: app code.
  - `components/`: reusable UI (e.g., `TransactionsTable.tsx`, `Charts.tsx`).
  - `data/`: local JSON fixtures (e.g., `sampleTransactions.json`).
  - Styles live alongside components (e.g., `ComponentName.css`).
- `public/`: static assets served by CRA.
- `build/`: production output (generated by `npm run build`).

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run all commands from `budget-dashboard-app/`:
- `npm install`: install dependencies.
- `npm start`: start dev server (http://localhost:3000) with fast refresh.
- `npm test`: run Jest + React Testing Library in watch mode.
- `npm run build`: create optimized production build to `build/`.
- `npm run eject`: expose CRA config (irreversible; avoid in PRs).

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Language: TypeScript (`.ts/.tsx`), strict mode enabled.
- Indentation: 2 spaces; max line length ~100 where practical.
- Components: PascalCase filenames (`BudgetSettings.tsx`).
- Variables/functions: `camelCase`; types/interfaces: `PascalCase`.
- Styles: `ComponentName.css` colocated with component.
- Linting: CRA ESLint (`react-app` preset). Fix warnings before opening PRs.

## Testing Guidelines
- Frameworks: Jest + React Testing Library.
- File names: `*.test.tsx|ts`, colocated under `src/` near the unit under test.
- Write user-focused tests (query by role/label; avoid brittle snapshots).
- Run: `npm test`. Coverage (optional/CI): `CI=true npm test -- --coverage`.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Commits: small, focused, imperative mood (e.g., "Add budget settings validation"). Conventional Commits (`feat:`, `fix:`) welcome but not required.
- PRs must include:
  - Clear description and rationale; link related issues.
  - Screenshots/GIFs for UI changes.
  - Testing notes (how to verify) and any new tests.
  - Confirmation that `npm test` passes and no console errors.

## Architecture Overview
- Single-page React app with state managed via hooks (`src/App.tsx`).
- Charts via `recharts`; sample data from `src/data/sampleTransactions.json`.
- No backend; all data is local and mock-friendly.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Do not commit secrets or `.env` files.
- Use Node.js v14+; reinstall after Node upgrades: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`.

## Continuous Integration
- CI runs via GitHub Actions at `.github/workflows/ci.yml` on pushes and PRs.
- Jobs use Node 18, run `npm ci` then `npm test -- --coverage` in `budget-dashboard-app/`.
- Ensure tests pass locally before opening a PR.
