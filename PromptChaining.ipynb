        "This notebook demonstrates a critical concept of Prompt Engineering called **Prompt Chaining**. It shows how we can leverage response from one prompt to chain to the next using stateful conversational capablity of Responses API, so an AI model can solve a complex, multi-step problem without a single bulky prompt, overflowing context window or latency overhead.<br>\n",

All estimates assume a cross-functional team:  \n • Backend (BE) engineers  \n • Data engineers  \n • Frontend (FE) engineer  \n • SRE/infra engineer  \n\n1. Phase 1 – Foundations (2–3 weeks) ~250 h  \n • Define event schema, idempotency keys, PII policy  \n    – BE: 40 h; Data: 10 h  \n • Instrument server paths & SDKs (web, iOS, Android, Node)  \n    – BE: 30 h; FE: 10 h  \n • Provision Kafka/Kinesis topics, schema registry  \n    – SRE: 40 h  \n • Build basic producer pipelines & sanity dashboards  \n    – BE: 40 h; Data: 20 h  \n • QA & integration tests  \n    – BE/FE: 20 h  \n\n2. Phase 2 – Real-time Pipeline & APIs (4–6 weeks) ~600 h  \n • Stream processors: dedupe, ordering window, PII scrub  \n    – BE: 120 h; Data: 80 h  \n • Storage: ClickHouse schema, MergeTree tuning, Redis cache  \n    – SRE: 40 h; Data: 40 h  \n • Build query APIs: /timelines, /search, /diff, POST annotations  \n    – BE: 100 h  \n • SDK enhancements (retry/offline queue, correlation IDs)  \n    – BE: 40 h; FE: 40 h  \n • End-to-end tests, backfill tooling, canary validations  \n    – Data: 40 h; BE: 20 h; SRE: 20 h  \n\n3. Phase 3 – Debug UI, Security, Rollout (3–4 weeks) ~350 h  \n • Debug Console UI: timeline view, filters, env-compare  \n    – FE: 120 h; BE: 40 h for endpoints  \n • RBAC, mTLS/JWT, rate limits, audit-logging  \n    – BE: 40 h; SRE: 20 h  \n • Observability: consumer lag, DLQ, SLO dashboards, alerts/runbooks  \n    – SRE: 40 h  \n • Documentation, training, staged tenant rollout  \n    – BE/FE/Data/SRE: 50 h  \n • Buffer for bug-fixes & iteration  \n    – All: 40 h  \n\nTotal estimated effort ~1,200 engineering hours (~150 days).  \n• If staffed as 2 BE, 0.5 Data, 0.5 FE, 0.5 SRE FTE → ~3 calendar months  \n• Key dependencies: infra capacity (Kafka, ClickHouse, Redis), SDK release cadence, schema-registry setup, tenant coordination for rollout.  \n\nThis breakdown will help the team size stories, plan sprints, and track progress against milestones.</div>"
