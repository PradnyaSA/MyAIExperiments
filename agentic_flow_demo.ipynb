Her hand lightly touches a large, transparent smart screen seamlessly integrated into the wardrobe wall.

Soft, diffused natural morning light floods the scene from a large window, enhancing textures and creating a serene glow. The mood is sophisticated, empowering, and effortlessly efficient. Focus on clean lines, aspirational aesthetic, and a sense of calm confidence. Color palette: muted neutrals (grays, creams, whites) with sophisticated pops of color in the clothing, and cool blue/green hues for the holographic interface.\n=================================================</div>"
