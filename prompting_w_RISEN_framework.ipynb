        "This notebook demonstrates a structured approach to prompt engineering using frameworks such as the R.I.S.E.N. framework.\n",
        "It also shows the difference in responses between unstructured/poorly structured and structured prompts.</br>\n",
        "*Pre-requisites:* To run this notebook, you need an access key to the OpenAI API. You can get your API key from [openai](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Topic: Prompt Engineering with a structured approach\n",
        "Prompt Engineering is a critical skill for maximizing AI performance, Optimizing Cost and Efficiency at scale, and Improving Consistency and Reliability. Above all, evolving models with sophisticated reasoning abilities thrive on techniques such as Chain-of-thought, few-shot prompting, and more.\n",
        "This hands-on exercise is a starting point to build some understanding about a structured approach to prompt engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Brief Explanation of one of the Structural frameworks - the R.I.S.E.N. Framework:</br>\n",
        "- R = ROLE(or persona): Giving a clear role helps the AI model establish the appropriate tone, expertise level, and perspective.\n",
        "- I = INSTRUCTIONS:     Giving a direct command helps the AI model understand specific directions about the task.\n",
        "- S = STEPS:            Giving a breakdown of the task into logical parts helps the AI model organize its thinking and prevents it from missing important information on multi-part requests.\n",
        "- E = EXAMPLES:         Giving an example or end goal helps the AI model format a response as expected.\n",
        "- N = NARROWING:        Giving restrictions on scope, length, or complexity helps the AI model work within given constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "A structured approach to writing a prompt is more likely to produce the results we expect. It helps AI models reduce ambiguity, scope creep, or even inconsistencies.\n",

Hereâ€™s a crisp, motivational proposal tailored to your development team:\n\n---\n\n# Proposal: Adopting Test-Driven Development (TDD) for Enhanced Software Quality\n\n## Problem Definition  \nAs our product and codebase grow in complexity, we face increasing challenges related to code maintainability, regression bugs, and unclear requirements. Current development practices sometimes lead to insufficient test coverage and higher cycle times for debugging and feature modifications. This slows our momentum and puts business continuity at risk.\n\n## Objectives  \n- To improve code quality and maintainability.\n- To reduce bugs in production through increased automated test coverage.\n- To strengthen team confidence when modifying or extending our codebase.\n- To foster a culture of clear requirement definition and documentation.\n\n## TDD Best Practices  \nTo ensure successful TDD implementation, the following best practices are to be ingrained in our workflow:\n- **Start with Tests:** Always begin by writing a failing test that defines the expected behavior (Red).\n- **Minimum Code for Success:** Implement the simplest code that will make the failing test pass (Green).\n- **Continuous Refactoring:** After a test passes, refactor the code for clarity and efficiency without altering its behavior, ensuring all tests continue to pass (Refactor).\n- **Small, Incremental Steps:** Make small, incremental changes; avoid writing large amounts of production code without tests.\n- **One Test at a Time:** Focus on one new failing test at a time to maintain clarity of intent.\n- **Test Readability:** Write clear, intention-revealing tests that provide living documentation for the codebase.\n- **Frequent Commits:** Commit changes frequently to maintain a clear development history and enable effective collaboration.\n- **Peer Reviews:** Encourage pair programming or code reviews focused on both code and test quality.\n\n## Implementation in SDLC Phases  \n\n**1. Requirements & Design**\n- Collaborate with stakeholders to define clear, testable requirements.\n- Break down features into testable units.\n\n**2. Development**\n- Adhere strictly to the TDD Red-Green-Refactor cycle.\n- Write unit tests before any production code for every new feature or bugfix.\n- Document non-trivial behaviors through well-named test cases.\n\n**3. Code Review**\n- Reviews must check for proper TDD adherence: all code changes should be accompanied by relevant tests.\n- Encourage discussion on test coverage, edge cases, and clarity.\n\n**4. Integration & Testing**\n- Maintain a CI pipeline that runs all tests automatically on every commit.\n- Use test results to gate releases and merge approvals.\n\n**5. Maintenance**\n- When fixing bugs, add a failing test that reproduces the issue first, and only then implement the fix to make the test pass.\n- Continuously refactor both code and test suites to accommodate evolving requirements.\n\n## Success Criteria / Rubrics  \nWeâ€™ll know we are succeeding by:\n- **Test Coverage:** 90%+ automated unit test coverage for new code.\n- **Defect Rate:** Reduction in bug reports from production and user acceptance testing.\n- **Development Cycle Time:** Faster feature delivery and bug resolution due to early detection and clear requirements.\n- **Code Reviews:** All pull requests demonstrate the Red-Green-Refactor cycle and include meaningful, passing tests.\n- **Team Satisfaction:** Positive feedback from the team about reduced debugging sessions and higher confidence in deployments.\n\n## Projected Gains  \n\n**Short-Term Gains**\n- Immediate feedback during development, catching errors early.\n- Lower time spent on debugging and regression testing.\n- Clearer code requirements and shared understanding within the team.\n- Early wins in reliability and developer confidence through enforced test coverage.\n\n**Long-Term Gains**\n- Significantly reduced maintenance cost as code remains modular and well-tested.\n- Ability to make large-scale changes or refactoring with minimal fear of breaking the system.\n- Evolving a robust, living test suite that acts as documentation and onboarding aid for new team members.\n- Cultural shift towards quality-first engineering, improving our reputation and stakeholder trust.\n\n## Conclusion  \nBy embracing TDD as a core development best practice, we position ourselves to build higher-quality, more maintainable, and resilient software. This methodology empowers each of us to not only deliver on requirements efficiently but also to take ownership in crafting robust and well-documented solutions. Letâ€™s champion TDD as our default workflow, supporting each other as we build a consistent, disciplined, and successful engineering culture. Your commitment and creativity will be pivotal, and together, we will raise our standards and delight our users with every release!\n\n---\n\nLetâ€™s make TDD our competitive advantageâ€”your expertise and dedication will make it a success!</div>"
