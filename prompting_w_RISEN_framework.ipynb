        "This notebook demonstrates a structured approach to prompt engineering using frameworks such as the R.I.S.E.N. framework.\n",
        "It also shows the difference in responses between unstructured/poorly structured and structured prompts.</br>\n",
        "*Pre-requisites:* To run this notebook, you need an access key to the OpenAI API. You can get your API key from [openai](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Topic: Prompt Engineering with a structured approach\n",
        "Prompt Engineering is a critical skill for maximizing AI performance, Optimizing Cost and Efficiency at scale, and Improving Consistency and Reliability. Above all, evolving models with sophisticated reasoning abilities thrive on techniques such as Chain-of-thought, few-shot prompting, and more.\n",
        "This hands-on exercise is a starting point to build some understanding about a structured approach to prompt engineering.\n",
        "\n",
        "Brief Explanation of one of the Structural frameworks - the R.I.S.E.N. Framework:</br>\n",
        "- R = ROLE(or persona): Giving a clear role helps the AI model establish the appropriate tone, expertise level, and perspective.\n",
        "- I = INSTRUCTIONS:     Giving a direct command helps the AI model understand specific directions about the task.\n",
        "- S = STEPS:            Giving a breakdown of the task into logical parts helps the AI model organize its thinking and prevents it from missing important information on multi-part requests.\n",
        "- E = EXAMPLES:         Giving an example or end goal helps the AI model format a response as expected.\n",
        "- N = NARROWING:        Giving restrictions on scope, length, or complexity helps the AI model work within given constraints.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "A structured approach to writing a prompt is more likely to produce the results we expect. It helps AI models reduce ambiguity, scope creep, or even inconsistencies.\n",
