I’d be happy to help you upgrade from the Standard plan to the Premium plan for a three-month period.\n\nResponse:\n1. Account & Plans  \n   – Your current plan: Standard at $10 / month  \n   – Premium plan: $20 / month  \n   – One-time administrative fee for plan changes: $5  \n\n2. Cost Breakdown for 3-Month Premium Term  \n   – 3 months × $20 / month = $60  \n   – + $5 admin fee  \n   – Total due: $65  \n\n3. Scheduling Your Upgrade  \n   You have two options:  \n   a) Effective at the start of your next billing cycle  \n      • You’ll pay $65 upfront for three full months of Premium service.  \n   b) Effective immediately  \n      • We’ll prorate your remaining days on Standard toward Premium (you’ll only pay the difference for the rest of this month), plus the $5 fee.  \n      • Then you’ll be charged $20 on each of the next two full monthly renewals.  \n\nPlease let me know which option you’d like—upgrade now or at your next cycle—and I’ll process it right away!</div>"
