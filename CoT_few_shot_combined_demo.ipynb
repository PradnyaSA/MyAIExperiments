Current plan  \n   â€¢ Standard at $10/month\n\n2. New plan  \n   â€¢ Premium at $20/month for the next 3 billing cycles  \n   â€¢ After 3 months, youâ€™ll automatically revert back to Standard at $10/month\n\n3. Fees  \n   â€¢ One-time administrative fee of $5 when we upgrade you today  \n   â€¢ One-time administrative fee of $5 when we downgrade you back in 3 months\n\n4. Charges overview  \n   â€¢ Months 1â€“3: Premium at $20/mo, billed on your normal renewal date  \n   â€¢ Upgrade fee (today): $5  \n   â€¢ Downgrade fee (at the end of month 3): $5  \n\nExample billing sequence  \nâ€“ Next invoice: $20 (Premium) + $5 (upgrade fee) = $25  \nâ€“ Following two months: $20 each  \nâ€“ In 3 monthsâ€™ time: $5 (downgrade fee) plus $10 (Standard) on that renewal  \n\nPlease confirm if youâ€™d like me to proceed with this plan change starting on your next billing date. If you prefer to switch immediately (and pay a pro-rated Premium charge for the remainder of this cycle), let me know and Iâ€™ll calculate that for you.</div>"
