        "This notebook demonstrates a Prompt Engineering technique called **Chain-Of-Thought(CoT)** when combined with **few-shot** prompting. It shows how CoT prompting enhances an AI model's ability to solve complex, multi-step problems.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "*Pre-requisites:* To run this notebook, you need an access key to the OpenAI API. You can get your API key from [openai](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).\n",
        "\n",
        "## Topic: Chain-Of-Thought + few-shots Prompting\n",
        "Evolving models with sophisticated reasoning abilities thrive on techniques such as Chain-of-Thought(CoT), few-shot prompting.<br>\n",
        "CoT prompting technique enables complex reasoning capabilities through intermediate reasoning steps.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Here is an example of customer servicing ChatBot experience before CoT:<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "- *customer:* \"I want to change my subscription from standard to premium for 3 months.\"\n",
        "- *chat-bot:* \"Sure, I'd be happy to assist you with that. I just need to verify some information: - Can I have your full name, please? - Could you also provide me with your account or subscription number for verification? As soon as I verify this information, I'll be able to process your request to upgrade to the premium subscription. Thank you!\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This response is quick but lacks the necessary context and transparency from the customer's point of view. It does not inform the customer how the model calculated these fees and whether it's being applied for each month or as a one-time fee to upgrade the subscription.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Now, here is how experience changes with CoT+few-shots prompting:<br>\n",
        "- *customer:* \"I want to change my subscription from standard to premium plan for next 3 months.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "- Chatbot's Internal CoT:\n",
        "  - Identify the user's intent: The user wants to upgrade their subscription.\n",

        "  - Access user's account details: Retrieve the current plan (\"Standard\") and billing history.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Access subscription plan details: Find the cost of the \"Standard\" plan $$($10/month)$$ and the \"Premium\" plan $$($20/month)$$\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Calculate the pro-rated fee: The customer is in the middle of their billing cycle.\n",
        "    - Current plan cost: $10/month.\n",

        "    - Time remaining in cycle: 15 days (out of 30).\n",
        "    - The price difference is $10/month.\n",
        "    - Calculate the pro-rated fee as $$(New plan cost - Old plan cost) * (Days  remaining / Total days in billing cycle)$$ <br>In this case, $$( \\$20 - \\$10 ) \\\\times ( \\\\frac{15}{30} ) = \\$5$$\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Identify additional fees/terms: Check for any specific upgrade fees or policy changes. The policy states a one-time administrative fee of $5 for a plan change.<br>\n",
        "\n",
        "  - Synthesize the final cost: The total cost will be the pro-rated difference plus the administrative fee:$$(\\$5 + \\$5)=\\$10$$\n",
        "  - Formulate a transparent and helpful response: Break down the cost calculation, explain each component, and confirm the next step.<br>\n",

Iâ€™d be happy to help you upgrade from the Standard plan to the Premium plan for a fixed 3-month term.  \n\nHereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:  \n1. Account & Current Plan  \n   â€¢ Youâ€™re currently on Standard at $10/month.  \n\n2. Premium Plan Cost  \n   â€¢ Premium is $20/month.  \n\n3. Plan-Change Fee  \n   â€¢ We apply a one-time administrative fee of $5 whenever you change plans.  \n\n4. Monthly Difference  \n   â€¢ Premium ($20) minus Standard ($10) = $10 extra per month.  \n\n5. 3-Month Term Calculation  \n   â€¢ Extra over Standard for 3 months: 3 Ã— $10 = $30  \n   â€¢ One-time admin fee: $5  \n   â€¢ Total due over these 3 months: $30 + $5 = $35  \n\n6. Billing Schedule  \n   â€¢ Your next invoice will include the $5 fee plus the first monthâ€™s $20 Premium charge.  \n   â€¢ For months 2 and 3, youâ€™ll be billed $20 each month.  \n\n7. End of 3-Month Term  \n   â€¢ After 3 months, you can either remain on Premium at $20/month or revert to Standard at $10/month. Just let us know your preference before the end of month 3.  \n\nNext Step  \nPlease confirm that youâ€™d like to proceed with this 3-month Premium upgrade, and Iâ€™ll finalize it for you. If you have any questions or need a different start date, just let me know!</div>"
