If each customer servicing agent spends 10 minutes per complex customer inquiry and handles 10 inquiries a day, that means they will spend 10*10=100 minutes a day. \n\n2. As there are 120 agents, they collectively would spend 100*120=12,000 minutes a day.\n\n3. Now, if we want to find out the total minutes spent over a year, we'll have to assume there aren't any weekends or holidays when the agents aren't working. Therefore, we'd multiply the daily total by 365 (the number of days in a year): 12,000*365 = 4,380,000 minutes. \n\nNow, if each customer servicing agent saves 1 minute on each complex inquiry, and still handles 10 inquiries a day, then: \n\n1. They would each save 1*10 = 10 minutes a day. \n\n2. With 120 agents, they collectively would save 10*120 = 1,200 minutes a day. \n\n3. Over a year, amounting to 1,200*365 = 438,000 minutes saved.\n\nHopefully, that answers all your questions! If you need anything else, don't hesitate to ask.
